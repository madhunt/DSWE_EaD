JSON NOTES

- python dictionaries are JSON objects (basically "universal object notation")
    - dict --> object; list/tuple --> array; etc.
- import json (already comes built in with python)

- SERIALIZATION: encoding JSON into a series of bytes to be stored/transmitted
    - encoding = write data to disk
    - decoding = read data into memory

- dump() : method to write data to files
- dumps() : write data to python string (dump s)

- load() : turn JSON encoded data into python object
- loads() : load from a string
