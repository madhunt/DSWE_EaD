# Using applications in scripts
While all applications have command line functionality, it is sometimes desired to call an application in a script. These scripts give examples of how to do so.

- `example_download_list.py` : Download data from a user-provided list of scene IDs (in csv format).

- `example_download_multiple_searches.py` : Download all data in a search from multiple years. For instance, this script was used to download all available DSWE data from 1990-2000 in one study area, to then run the proportions code on.
   
- `example_download_search.py` : Download all data from one search result.

- `example_search_scenes.py` : Search for scenes and view results.
