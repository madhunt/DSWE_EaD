# Proportions inundated by open water and partial surface water

This code (when complete) will calculate proprtions of observations inundated by open water and partial surface water for different periods of time (monthly, seasonally, yearly, and semi-decadally). 

Interpreted (INTR) or interpreted with masks (INWM) layers from the DSWE dataset will be used as inputs to this code.

The code will return the proportion open surface water and the proportion partial surface water for each timeframe.
